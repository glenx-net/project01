			<h2>Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</h2>
<p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? I call it luck. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! What!?</p>
<ol>
<li>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</li><li>As you wish.</li><li>What?!</li>
</ol>

<h3>You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!</h3>
<p>I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ye-ha!</li><li>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</li><li>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.</p>
<p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. As you wish. You mean it controls your actions? Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.</p>
<p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I call it luck. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</p>

<p>Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom. No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it.</p>
<p>You don't win friends with salad. <strong> Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog.</strong> <em> Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son.</em> " Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone.</p>
<h2>Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns."</h2>
<p>Save me, Jeebus. Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work.</p>
<ol>
<li>Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get.</li><li>Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me?</li><li>What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you're experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box…</h3>
<p>Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me. I stand by my racial slur. We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition.</li><li>No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it.</li><li>I didn't get rich by signing checks.</li>
</ul>

<p>What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man? I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies.</p>
